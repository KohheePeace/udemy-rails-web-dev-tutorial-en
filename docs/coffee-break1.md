# Coffee Break 1

## Is **jQuery** outdated or dead?
=> No.

## Why I choose jQuery in this course ?
=> Easy for beginners.

It is ==**enough**== to make an MVP.

## What do you think about React.js or Vue.js etc...?
=> You ==**should**== learn react.js or vue.js ==to become an web developer==.

==**But the goal of this course is to make an MVP.**==

If your MVP get attention after release, then hire professional coder if needed (It is easy for professional coder to replace it because they of course know jQuery).
