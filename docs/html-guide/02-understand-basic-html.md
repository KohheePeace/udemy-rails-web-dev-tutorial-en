# Understand basic HTML code

## Chapter Goals:
- Understand last chapter html code


## Check the meaning of the html code.
==**The most important thing is always google it!**==

This is the code we used in last chapter.

`test.html`
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Title of the document</title>
</head>

<body>
  Content of the document......
</body>

</html>
```

Let's check this code from top to bottom.

### 1. `<!DOCTYPE html>`
Let's google "**what is doctype in html**"

![What is Doctype of html](../img/html-guide/what-is-doctype-of-html.png)  

I choose this link https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_doctype.asp

![What is Doctype link](../img/html-guide/what-is-doctype-link.png)  
> The <!DOCTYPE> declaration must be the very first thing in your HTML document, before the <html> tag.

> The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not an HTML tag; ==**it is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.**==



### 2. `<head>`
Let's google **"what is head tag of html"**
